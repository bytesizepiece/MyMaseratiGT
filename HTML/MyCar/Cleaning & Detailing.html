        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <p>
            After spending some time researching and browsing <a href="www.detailingworld.co.uk">detailingworld.co.uk</a>, it became clear the old bucket, sponge and chamois is not the way to clean and look after a car.
        <br><br>
        In summary, the best process for cleaning a car and protecting the paint from scratches and swirl marks is:
        <ul>
            <li>Gentle spray all over with pressure washer</li>
            <li>Spray car with "pre-cleaner", often in the form of snow foam, leave for 10mins</li>
            <li>Clean the wheels and tyres - Try to avoid getting the brakes wet, or getting cleaner products on them</li>
            <li>Wash off pre-clean foam with pressure washer</li>
            <li>Use the 2 bucket method for shampooing the car - one bucket of water for cleaning the wash mitt(s), the other bucket for "clean" shampoo water</li>
            <li>Gentle rinse with a pressure washer</li>
            <li>Use a micro-fiber drying towel drying from the top of the car to the bottom</li>

            <li>Note: If you drop a cloth or towel on the floor, do not use it until thoroughly washed as it will pick up grit.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Clay / Polish / Waxing</h1>
        <p>
          This is something to do on an as needed basis, normally once or twice a year. 
          <br><br><br><br>
          <h4>Clay bar</h4>
          A clay bar is used to "decontaminate" the clear (top) coat of the paint. This process is done before polishing or applying wax to ensure the surface is smooth and clean.
          <br><br>
          To see if this is needed, put your hand in a plastic sandwich bag and gently wipe your hand over the paint. If it feels like the paint has a grainy surface, it needs a clay bar to remove the contaminants as these could damage the clear coat, or paint when polishing, or prevent the wax from being applied properly. A well applied wax can last months, otherwise it might only last a week or two.

         <br><br>
        <img
          class="image"
          src="../../images/Cleaning/claybarbeforeandafter.jpeg"
          alt="clay before after"
        />    
          <br><br><br><br>
          <h4>Polishing</h4>
          Polishing is done after claying the car and is done to remove small scratches and swirl markets in the clear coat. Most polishes provide a two step process on the clear coat:
<br><br>  
<ol type="1">
  <li>Cut - This is the abrasive stage (like sanding), eventually the abrasive parts breakdown to allow the next stage.</li>
  <br>
  <li>Polish - This creates a fine finish to smooth out the abrasion and leave a smooth finish. </li>
</ol>
          <br><br>
          The process of polishing will remove an amount of clear coat, therefore there is a limit to how often it can be done. Once a year is probably a good basis assuming you avoid machine car washes and stick to the 2 bucket wash method.
         <br><br><br>
         Polishing before and after:

          alt="Swirl mark before and after"
        />   


         <br><br><br><br>

          <h4>Waxing</h4>
          Waxing provide a deep shine to the paint, provides a hydro-phobic property to the paint, a protective barrier to the paintwork and makes cleaning easier.
          <br><br>
          Waxing is best done when the paint has been "decontaminated" as it will last longer. Most waxes will last around 3 months, synthetic waxes 6 to 12 months. A ceramic coating (different to wax) can last 3 years.
