    <section>
      <button type="button" class="collapsible">+    Electrical Reset (battery disconnect) </button>
      <div class="content">
        <br />
        <h5 id="centreHeading">
          COMPONENT SELF-LEARNING IN THE EVENT OF BATTERY DISCONNECTION...
        </h5>
        <p id="centreHeading">
          After connecting the battery negative terminal, the following
          self-learning operations must be performed to ensure that certain
          connected devices acknowledge the system again:
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h5>"EPB FAILURE" AND "PARKING BRAKE ENGAGED" WARNING LIGHTS</h5>
        <p>
          Each time the battery is reconnected, the “EPB FAILURE” and “PARKING
          BRAKE ENGAGED” warning lights flash for about 10 seconds and then go
          off. This is normal and not indicative of a failure.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h5>MOTOR DRIVEN THROTTLE SELF-LEARNING</h5>
        <p>
          Turn the ignition switch to ON and wait at least 15 seconds. After
          performing the self-learning cycle for the “throttle position”, you
          must perform the same cycle also for the timing variators (VVT). To do
          this, start the engine and let it idle for about 20 seconds.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h5>CENTRAL DOOR LOCKING</h5>
        <p>LOCK and UNLOCK the doors using the remote control.</p>
        <br /><br />
        <h5>NIT (IT node) and CLOCK</h5>
        <p>
          Turn the ignition switch to ON
          <br />
          Turn on the IT Node, reset the correct time and date since the IT node
          looses this information every time the battery is disconnected.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h5>FRONT SEATS</h5>
        <p>
          Following any power cut-out (e.g. after using the battery master
          switch or if the battery has run flat), check the seats to ensure that
          they are operating properly when the power supply is available.
          <br /><br />
          Perform the following procedures on both seats in the event of a
          malfunction. When the ignition key is at STOP and the door next to the
          seat concerned is closed, open the door and start the following
          procedure within 5 seconds, then complete it within 10 seconds.
          <br /><br />
         <ul>
          <li> Forward - STOP </li>
          <li> Backward - STOP </li>
          <li> Forward - STOP </li>
          <li> Backward - STOP </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          Tilt the seatback fully forward and wait until the seat performs two
          complete travels (forward and backward).
          <br /><br />
          Put the backrest in the normal position. If you need to disconnect the
          battery, wait at least 30 seconds from the last seat movement. If you
          disconnect the battery before, you will have to run the initialisation
          procedure.
        </p>
        <br /><br />

        <h5>TGK VALVE STROKE SELF-LEARNING</h5>
        <p>
          Every time the battery is connected, the acquisition procedure relating to both the water valves is started. After connecting the battery, turn the key to ON and wait at least 15 seconds before starting the engine.
          <br>  <br>
          The phases for a correct self-learning of the strokes are the the following:
          <br> <br> 
          <ul>
       
            <li> complete valve opening (max. 6 seconds)</li>
            <li> memorisation of the opening position of both valves (950 on the average) </li>
            <li> complete valve closing (max. 6 seconds) </li>
            <li> memorisation of the closing position of both valves (50 on the
          average) </li> 
            <li> memorisation of both valves' stroke (Stroke=Opening-Closing,
          900 on the average) </li>
          </ul>
<br><br>
          <h5> Stroke Analysis </h5>
          <p>if even only one of the 2 strokes
          is below 500, both strokes are assigned a recovery value of 800 and
          the procedure is repeated upon the next network wake-up or when the
          key is turned to ON if both strokes are above 500, the strokes
          correspond to those calculated and the procedure will not be repeated
          upon the next network wake-up or when the key is turned to ON</p>
        </p>

            <button type="button" class="collapsible">+    Battery Replacement</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>A bad battery can create a number of issues and errors. If the battery is 5 years old (or more), it might be worth considering a replacement to minimise the risk of an error.
          <br><br>
          One recommended battery is:
          <br>
          Bosch S5 Car Battery 12V 100Ah 830CCA S5013 Type 019 (Granturismo - 2008+)
        <br><br>
        Most decent batteries will come with a 5 year warranty. Keep a copy of the receipt in a sealed plastic bag under the battery so it never gets lost.
        <br><br>
          If the car is not going to be used for a few days, connecting a battery conditioner can be helpful in maintaining battery health. CTEK ???? offer a great device which are reliable and easy to use.

        <p>
This is the OEM sensor but without the Maserati/Ferrari branding. Each one comes with a new valve and seals, so no need to buy the valve service kit (the alloy wheels direct photo doesn't show the valve).

<br><br>
At the time of writing they are  £67.20 each plus  £10 delivery inc VAT, so just over  £280 delivered for 4.
<br><br>
Compatibility list from US vendor TPMS: <br>
<ul>
  <li>2010 GranTurismo </li>
<li> 2010 GranTurismo S Automatic</li>
<li> 2009 GranTurismo </li>
<li> 2009 GranTurismo S </li>
<li>2008 GranTurismo </li>
<li>2008 GranTurismo S </li>
</ul>

<br>
Note: It doesn't matter if you move the sensors to a different corner because each wheel arch has its own aerial to tell the car which sensor it's talking to. So you just have the new sensor fitted and press the button to calibrate, as in the manual.
