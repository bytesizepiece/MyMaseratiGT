        <h1>Buying Guide</h1>
        <h6>This is guideline advice taken from a variety of sources - Reasearch and buy at your own risk</h6>
<br>
<p>
The general advice is to remember the Granturismo is a ~£100k car when new and therefore has servicing and repair costs associated with a car of that price range. 
<br><br>
Buying with caution and getting the best car for your money is the best way to an enjoyable ownership.
<br><br>          
Most people who are familiar with buying used premium cars will suggest having a pre-purchase inspection carried out. This involves either having a specialist visit the car, or taking it to a specialist to carry out the inspection. They will then issue a report detailing issues with the car and suggested prices to recitfy it.
<br><br>
Generally the best practise is to find a car you like, then:
<ul>
              <li>Agree a price and conditions of sale with the dealer and for a pre-purchase inspection to be carried out</li>
              <li>Have the car inspected at Maserati specialist, or have a mobile inspection completed.</li>
              <li>If there are any red-flags, discuss with the dealer and try to have them corrected, or factored into the price.</li>
              </ul>
<br>
Do not be pressured into buying a car you are not sure about, the Granturismo is known to be reliable, but a bad car can get expensive very quickly.</li>
<br><br>
        <br>
        If you decide to not have a pre-purchase inspection carried out, some points to look at are:
            </p>
        <ul>
        <h5>MOT History</h5>
        <li>Look up the numberplate on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-mot-history">government MOT website</a> and look for previous fails and advisory points.</li>
        
        <h5>Service History</h5>
        <li>Service intervals are 2 years or 12,500 miles.
        <li> Check what items have been included in previous services - <a href="/HTML/RunningCosts/ServiceSchedule.html">Service Schedule</a> often non-specialists will miss service items.</li>

         <h5>Bodywork condition</h5>
        <li>Check to damage to the body work, or any signs of repairs, such as pannel alignment or mis-matching paint.</li>
        <li>Look at the front bumper and bonnet for excessive stone chips</li>
        <li>Check wheels for damage.</li>
        
        <h5>Interior condition</h5>
        <li>Inspect the interior for any tears or heavy wear. </li>
          <li>Check the roof liner for signs of sagging.</li>
        
        
          <h5>Subframe</h5>
        <li>Subframe rust issues are hard to check unless you get under the car, but this starts being an issue at around 10yrs old due to the UK salty roads. If treated early, it is around £600 to £1,000 (treat/check every 3-5yrs), but if the subframe requires major work or replacing it is around £4,000 to fix</li>
        
        
       <h5>Clutch wear</h5>
          <li class="liIndent1">The Auto model (with central gear selector) has a ZF torque converter gearbox which is reliable and should have any issues with wear. It is worth checking all gears can be easily selected.</li>
          <li class="liIndent1">The MC Shift (no central gear selector) can require a clutch between 20,000 and 50,000 miles of use. Any service center should be able to confirm the clutch wear reading (which is an estimate). The rate of clutch wear depends on how the car is driven and traffic conditions (city stop/start causes more wear). Clutches are around £4,000 to replace and will normally require changing with a wear percentage of 70% to 80%</li>
          
        <h5>Brakes - Discs and Pads</h5>
        <li>Brake disk and pads - All models are expensive for discs and pads, but the 4.7 Granturismo front discs are around £1,500 and pads £750 (parts only). Check how many miles ago they were changed, or for signs of corrosion or a large lip on the disc.</li>

        <h5>Cam Variator</h5>
        <li>This can be an issue for 2007 to 20210 Granturismos - If the engine number is above, 148697 there should be no issue as it was a known issue fixed by Maserati.</li>
        <li> Variators typically go between 40,000-60,000 miles and cost around £2,000. A rattle on cold start is the first sign of an issue. </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9abUXB7Cteo">Youtube Video of 4.2 cam variator noise</a></li>

          <h5>Tyres</h5>
        <li>Tyres cost around £300 each and can wear quickly due to the power and weight of the car.</li>
        <li>For UK roads and weather, the general consensus is Michelin Pilot Sport 4 is the preferred tyre.</li>

        <h5>Battery</h5>
        <li>Batteries can be the source of a number of issues - if the original battery has been installed for a number of years, or a new battery has not been looked after or had a deep discharge, it would be worth considering a new one.</li>
     
</ul>
